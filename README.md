## Tienda Adormecida
by Equipo Adormecido (Team Asleep for all you _guiris_, I suppose?)

An e-commerce mockup consuming both eBay and WalMart APIs with a side order of popular social network login options just for the fun of it.

List of technologies we'll be using here in no real order: npm, jQuery, jQueryUI, Babel, Gulp, Sass, Font Awesome, Bootstrap, lots and lots of Monster Energy and of course the start of the show: React!

Star us for luck!
